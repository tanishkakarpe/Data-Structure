/*Implement program Count all possible Paths 
between two Vertices.
Statement Count the total number of ways or paths 
that exist between two vertices in a directed graph. 
These paths donâ€™t contain a cycle, the simple enough 
reason is that a cycle contains an infinite number of 
paths and hence they create a problem.
Input: Count paths between A and E
Output: Total paths between A and E are 4
Input: Count paths between A and C
Output: Total paths between A and C are 2
